Hello, my name is Maciej and i'm aspiring to become a data analyst.

In order for this I decided to do a project to find out about demanded skills for data analysis based on job offers and expected salary 

For this I need to answer several questions:

1. What are top-paying jobs for my role?
2. What are skills required for these jobs?
3. What are the most in-demand skills for my role?
4. What are top skills based on salary for my role?
5. What are the optimal skills to learn? (both high demand and high paying)

First 2 questions are slightly more long-term, because top-paying jobs are generally for people with high experience, which means that they are probably not available for me right now due to lack of experience,
but nevertheless it's useful to know them in order to plan long term vision of my career development

3rd and 5th questions are probably the most important questions for now. As for 3rd question in order to get experience I need to pretty much get any job in data field and knowledge of high in-demand skills opens up more job offers for me. Answer to 5th question gives me information about what to focus on right now.
